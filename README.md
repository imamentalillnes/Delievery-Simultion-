# Delievery Simultion

-  &emsp; This is a simulation of a package delivery company and how they manage to delivery their packages. This company owns trucks which get stopped by a passing train and a number of drones that do not. This simulation should be able to figure out what percentage of packages need to be delivered by drones in order to get the lowest delivery time.
